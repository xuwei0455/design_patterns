design-patterns
===============

A collection of design patterns which is just for learning.


Current Patterns:

__Creational Patterns__:

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:| ----------- |
| [Abstact Factory](Abstract Factory.py) | use a generic function with specific factories |
| [Builder](Builder.py) | instead of using multiple constructors, builder object receives parameters and returns constructed objects |
| [Factory Method](Factory Method.py) | delegate a specialized function/method to create instances |
| [Prototype](Prototype.py) | use a factory and clones of a prototype for new instances (if instantiation is expensive) |
| [Singleton](Singleton.py) | restricts the instantiation of a class to one object |
| [Simple Factory](SimpleFactory.py) | a simple version for [Factory Method](Factory Method.py) |


__Structural Patterns__:

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:| ----------- |
| [Adapter](Adapter.py) | adapt one interface to another using a white-list |
| [Bridge](Bridge.py) | a client-provider middleman to soften interface changes |
| [Decorator](Decorator.py) | wrap functionality with other functionality in order to affect outputs |
| [Facade](Facade.py) | use one class as an API to a number of others |
| [Flyweight](Flyweight.py) | transparently reuse existing instances of objects with similar/identical state |
| [Proxy](Proxy.py) | an object funnels operations to something else |

__Behavioral Patterns__:

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:| ----------- |
| [Command](Command.py) | bundle a command and arguments to call later |
| [Mediator](Mediator.py) | an object that knows how to connect other objects and act as a proxy |
| [Observer](Observer.py) | provide a callback for notification of events/changes to data |
| [State](State.py) | logic is organized into a discrete number of potential states and the next state |
| [Strategy](Strategy.py) | selectable operations over the same data |
